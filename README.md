a slightly different syntax than earlier versions. Mac's have Python installed. If you are using a Mac, confirm that the one
installed is the right version.

Download the folder simple_gui along with its contents. Keep all contents in the folder. It is best you do not change or 
modify them to gaurantee that the program runs correctly. If you wish to make changes, it is best to consult Jacques or Tom
first.
